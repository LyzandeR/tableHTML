\title{Create a css file or string}
\usage{
make_css(..., file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{css style definitions. Each object you provide must be a list of three elements. 
The first element will be a vector of the selectors to be styled (e.g. table, th, an id or html 
class). If the first element is a vector of length greater than one then the selectors will be
comma separated in the css. The second element will be a vector of the css definitions and the 
third element will a vector of the values of those definitions.}

\item{file}{Character sting. If a file name is provided then the css code will be printed into
that file. If the argument is NULL (default) then a string will be returned.}
}
\value{
css definitions.

}
\details{
\code{make_css} will create a css file or string which can also be used in shiny. If the argument 
  file is provided the css code will be printed out to the file. The file can then be used in 
  shiny with the \code{includeCSS} function. Alternatively there are two ways to use 
  \code{make_css} in order to add css to your shiny app. If you have a very small css file or you
  are just testing your app you can use \code{tags$style} with \code{make_css} directly. There is 
  an example in the examples section. Another way (which will make your code cleaner) is to 
  create your css in global.R assign it to a variable and then use that variable with 
  \code{tags$style}. There is another example on the examples section. Keep in mind that for 
  complete shiny apps it is best practice to use a file and load it with \code{includeCSS}. This 
  will be faster as well as it won't run the code to create the css file each time.
